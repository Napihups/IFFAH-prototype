1.) Do you think that parent should understand our child's behaviour on the internet ?

2.) Do you think it's important for parent to be aware of their child's activities on
social medias like facebook, twitter, instagram and more, for example... 
knowing what content they shared, what content they get access to and see?

3.) Do you think it's important that parent should have the power to control what their childrens do in social media and the internet, so that they can stop their child from sharing any bad or inappropriate
contents to the social medias/internet and to also prevent their child from getting access to something
that parent may not want their child to be exposed to, example..any near-sexual contents, violents, or even
gossip-related contents etc...?
